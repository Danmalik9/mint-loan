# Mint Loan

A decentralized lending protocol on the Stacks blockchain that enables dynamic loan minting, flexible terms, and reputation-based borrowing.

## Overview

Mint Loan is a comprehensive lending platform that enables:
- Flexible and permissionless loan creation
- Reputation-based credit scoring
- Dynamic interest rate mechanisms
- Secure and transparent loan governance
- Community-driven risk management

## Architecture

The platform consists of several key smart contracts that work together:

### Loan Marketplace
Handles the core lending mechanisms, including:
- Loan creation and minting
- Interest rate calculations
- Collateral management
- Loan status tracking
- Liquidation protocols

### Loan Terms
Manages the legal and technical framework for loans:
- Configurable loan parameters
- Collateralization requirements
- Interest rate models
- Loan agreement validation
- Repayment tracking

### Borrower Reputation
Tracks and manages borrower credibility:
- Credit scoring algorithms
- Historical loan performance
- Default risk assessment
- Reputation-based lending limits
- Incentives for good financial behavior

### Loan Governance
Enables community-driven protocol evolution:
- Parameter adjustment proposals
- Risk management voting
- Protocol upgrade mechanisms
- Decentralized decision making
- Stake-weighted governance

## Smart Contract Interface

### Template Registry

```clarity
;; Register a new template
(define-public (register-template
    (title (string-ascii 50))
    (description (string-ascii 500))
    (tags (list 5 (string-ascii 20)))
    (documentation-url (optional (string-ascii 100)))
    (repository-url (optional (string-ascii 100)))
    (clarity-versions (list 5 (string-ascii 10)))
    (platforms (list 3 (string-ascii 20)))
) => (response uint bool))

;; Publish a new template version
(define-public (publish-template-version
    (template-id uint)
    (version (string-ascii 10))
    (content-hash (buff 32))
    (release-notes (string-ascii 200))
) => (response bool uint))
```

### Marketplace

```clarity
;; Purchase a template
(define-public (purchase-template 
    (template-id uint)
) => (response bool uint))

;; Create escrow payment
(define-public (create-escrow-payment 
    (template-id uint)
) => (response uint uint))
```

### License Management

```clarity
;; Create a new license
(define-public (create-license
    (license-type uint)
    (name (string-utf8 50))
    (description (string-utf8 500))
    (attribution-required bool)
    (modification-allowed bool)
    (commercial-use-allowed bool)
    (fee uint)
) => (response uint uint))
```

### Reputation System

```clarity
;; Submit a review
(define-public (submit-review 
    (template-id uint)
    (rating uint)
    (review-text (string-utf8 500))
    (template-owner principal)
) => (response bool uint))
```

### Governance

```clarity
;; Create governance proposal
(define-public (create-proposal 
    (title (string-ascii 100))
    (description (string-utf8 1000))
    (function-name (string-ascii 128))
    (function-args (list 20 (string-utf8 100)))
    (voting-period-days uint)
) => (response uint uint))
```
